# This is MY Submission
I hope you find it acceptable

### Please note that:
- I work with flask framework, It's the first time I work with django or pytest, I started learning them two days ago.
- I know very little about Docker, and it was not included in the requirements, I got most of the answers from the web.
- I am a quick learner and I would like to have an opportunity just like this to prove myself.
